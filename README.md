# Japanese Morphman Tracker

## About
A react based web application for tracking your japanese progress by utilizing Anki Morphman's Readability Analyzer. This web application stores your Readability Line %, Known Instances % and Uknown Moprhs(optional) and associates it with the provided title.

### Features
  1. Fetching some Media data from Anilist's API depending on the provided title.
  2. Using Firebase's Authentication and Firestore to store user's data.
  3. Ability to add shows as batches by providing the application with a readability_log.txt generated by Morphman Readability Analyzer
  4. Anilist like user expirience when it comes to storing, filtering and sorting your progress.

## Disclaimer
This is my first React project made for personal use. There may be a lot of issues and unexpected behaviours.

## Notes
**This web application is not associated with AniList in anyway.**
Currently there are little to now error handling present. If something is not working as expected please keep an eye on the console. It may provide some insight into what is going on. Also, when adding a new show entry makes sure that the title of the show matches the one on [Anilist](https://anilist.co/), this is needed for an Anilist's API to fetch media data from.
